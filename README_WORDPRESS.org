Structured AI persona management for WordPress. Build reusable prompts, stream chats, and automate persona workflows.

== Description ==

AI Persona helps teams create reusable AI personas inside WordPress.

* Build structured prompts via the AI Persona custom post type (role, guidelines, constraints, examples).
* Stream chat responses through the built-in block and shortcode with support for Server-Sent Events.
* Connect to local Ollama models or remote providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) via the provider abstraction.
* Import/export personas in JSON for automation workflows.
* View analytics dashboards (when logging enabled) to understand provider usage and top personas.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install via the Plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu.
3. Optional: visit **Settings → AI Persona** to configure provider credentials and permissions.
4. Create a persona under **AI Personas** and embed it using the block or shortcode `[ai_persona_chat]`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin require remote AI providers? =

No. By default the plugin connects to a local Ollama instance (`minimax-m2:cloud`). You can switch to OpenAI or Anthropic in the settings screen.

= Where are analytics logs stored? =

When enabled, logs are appended to `wp-content/uploads/ai-persona/persona.log`. The dashboard truncates user inputs for privacy.
